SWE4S Project: Single Particle Tracking

**Project goal:** develop a Python-based pipeline to process single molecule movies, generate particle trajectories, and calculate properties such as diffusion coefficients and dwell times.

**Inputs**
TIF or ND2 (proprietary from NIS-Elements) movie with fluorescently labeled proteins of interest.

**Outputs**
* processed movie (background subtracted & smoothed)
* particle trajectories
* diffusion coefficients & particle dwell times
